    The words on the page shrink
as the browser window on a PC
shrinks.

    Is that intended?
        Yes.

    The overall look and feel
is starting to set in.

        What's next?

    The side menu works great
on mobile, portrait mode.
Landscape mode on mobile is a
terrible experience, although
the menu doesn't show when not
in use, it looks too big.
Landscape mode has proven to break
the site's footer.

        What about site's content?
Firstly, I believe is fair to say,
that resources are going mostly towards
the structure of the site, and its
navigational feel. The mission
statement of the site is a close
second. I fix computers for a living,
but now all of my free time has been
dedicated to the site. I hope to finish
soon. Maybe there after more keyboards
will arrive.

The menu is improving.
I will use this site as a jumpstart for the manin site.
The next thing to do is to create better documentation.
I want to be able to edit the site swiftly.
Documenting the progress and the next releases will help.
