## Optimizations
### <a id="4/6/2025">4/6/2025</a>
- [Go back to the Appendix](#appendix)

**The menu was updated, and is mobile responsive. When open, it can be navigated with ease. The css file under the code directory that sees the behavoir of the menu, was edited also, there is a copy of the old one in the directory.**
- **Plan**
    - I would like to work in the menu items, what it should have and how it should look like. I feel like pictures are an important aspect of the content, so they will be included with every content addition. I like the randomization of images in teh menu, perhpas a similar take can be added to the menu pictures
- Also I would like to implement the button modifier for the language content. I have no idea how this will be implemented, but I feel liek it will be a challenging process. Look inside the other project for inspiration: [line 56 English File](https://github.com/Omar27522/Work-on-This-as-a-template-for-the-new-site/blob/main/include/_code/page.php#L56), [line 80 Spanish File](https://github.com/Omar27522/Work-on-This-as-a-template-for-the-new-site/blob/main/include/_code/pagina.php#L80)

+ Status <b>On track</b>
