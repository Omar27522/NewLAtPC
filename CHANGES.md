## Optimizations

**The menu was updated, and is mobile responsive. When open, it can be navigated with ease. The css file under the code directory that sees the behavoir of the menu, was edited also, there is a copy of the old one in the directory.**
- **Plan**
    - I would like to work in the menu items, what it should have and how it should look like. I feel like pictures are an important aspect of the content, so they will be included with every content addition. I like the randomization of images in the menu, perhaps a similar take can be added to the menu pictures
- Also I would like to implement the button modifier for the language content. I have no idea how this will be implemented, but I feel like it will be a challenging process. Look inside the other project for inspiration: [line 56 English File](https://github.com/Omar27522/Work-on-This-as-a-template-for-the-new-site/blob/main/include/_code/page.php#L56), [line 80 Spanish File](https://github.com/Omar27522/Work-on-This-as-a-template-for-the-new-site/blob/main/include/_code/pagina.php#L80)

+ Status <b>On track</b>

**There was an attempt to make the menu sticky, but the site was much more buggy. There is another branch showcasing this attempt, for now the site is being migrated from its current live state**
- **What's Going On?**
    - The site is slowly shaping its flow state. The translation implementation has been added, and will look much better. There was an attempt at changing the menu. Also there is a font that is being used for the logo. The site's architecture is a fundamental aspect of how the site will be built. for now, there is a content function in the middle of the page.php. each location will have an index as well as a content page which at the moment houses arrays. the content directory houses the many pages of the site. I'm liking the naming convention of the site as a whole, it almost make sense. for example the content is heavily stated as the monolithic function, which I heavily rely on and is the powerhouse of the site, therefore "content" is used again and again to make a strong case to its use.

+ Status <b>Delayed but, back On track</b>
